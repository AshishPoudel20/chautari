# Chautari — Build Brief (Prototype Scope)

Mobile-first community Q&A app for the Nepali diaspora in Australia (Greater Melbourne, v1). Users ask questions and get answers from community members and verified local experts (migration agents, accountants, GPs, etc.). Stack: React Native (Expo). English only. No dark mode.

## Personas
- Asker: recent grad on a visa, asks visa/tax/life questions, wants fast credible answers, sometimes anonymously.
- Verified Expert: e.g. MARA migration agent, answers to build reputation, has a public profile with a contact link.
- Community Answerer: long-time resident who answers from lived experience.

## Out of scope (do NOT build)
Direct messages, blocking, editing posts, best-answer marking, photos in replies, @-mentions, notification preferences, profile privacy, in-app payments, bilingual UI, dark mode, public web app, real backend.

## Data layer
Mock everything locally — in-memory or AsyncStorage. Seed ~15 sample questions across categories, a dozen answers, and 3 verified experts based on the personas above. No Twilio, Supabase, Firebase, or real API keys.

## Done criteria
App launches clean with `npx expo start`, all listed screens reachable, core flows work (signup → feed → ask → answer → expert profile → follow). Include a README explaining what's implemented vs mocked and how to run it.
